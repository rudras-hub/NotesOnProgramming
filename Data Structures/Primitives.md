# Primitives

## Data Structure Overview
- Data Structures refer to how you store and interact with data.
- Choosing one data structure over the other has impact on performance and resources (memory).
- Basic Types: Types with no sub-components or structure. (`int`, `char`)
- Composite Data Types: Types which are composite of primitive types (`array`, `string`)
- Built-in Type: Types for which language provides built-in support.
    - Basic types + Composite Data Types.

## Primitives General 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type):
> Primitive data type is either of the following
> - Basic Type
> - Built-in Type

- A built-in composite types are usually _not_ primitives, but this can vary with languages. 
- Basic primitive type are usually faster than composite types. 
- Basic primitive types are usually value types.

### Common Primitive Types:
- Integers (`int`, `long`, `short`, `byte`)
- Floating Point Number (`single`, `double`, `decimal`)
- Fixed Point Number
- `char`
- Boolean
- Reference (pointer)

> NOTE: C# Strings are not basic they are _composed_ of chars. In Javascript strings are basic types.
